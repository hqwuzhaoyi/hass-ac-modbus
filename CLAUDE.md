## Project Overview

Home Assistant Air Conditioning Modbus Integration - A modern TypeScript/Next.js system for real-time monitoring and control of Modbus air conditioners with intelligent register discovery. Features both basic monitoring and advanced AI-powered register analysis.

**Architecture:**
1. **Next.js Full-Stack App** - Modern web interface with real-time monitoring
2. **WebSocket Servers** - Multiple server modes (basic/enhanced/demo) for different use cases  
3. **Enhanced Scanning System** - AI-powered register discovery with parallel processing
4. **Real-time Change Tracking** - Monitor register changes as you operate the AC remotely

## Common Commands

### Main Application
- `npm install` - Install all dependencies
- `npm run dev` - Start complete development environment (WebSocket + Next.js)
- `npm start` - Start Next.js production server (port 3002)
- `npm run build` - Build Next.js production bundle
- `npm run lint` - Run Next.js linting
- `npm test` - Run Jest tests

### WebSocket Server Modes
- `npm run ws` - Basic WebSocket server with known registers
- `npm run ws:enhanced` - Enhanced server with real Modbus device integration
- `npm run ws:demo` - Demo server with simulated data for testing
- `npm run monitor` - Alias for basic WebSocket server

### Scanning Commands (AI-Powered)
- `npm run scan` - Basic Modbus register scan
- `npm run scan:enhanced` - Enhanced parallel scan with intelligent analysis
- `npm run scan:smart` - Smart optimized scan with adaptive algorithms
- `npm run scan:stats` - View scan history and statistics
- `npm run scan:compare` - Compare different scanning strategies

### MQTT & Integration
- `npm run bridge` - Start MQTT bridge to Home Assistant

## Architecture

### WebSocket Server Layer
- **server.js** - Basic WebSocket server with known registers (11 registers)
- **server-enhanced-simple.js** - Enhanced server with intelligent register discovery
- **server-demo.js** - Demo server with simulated AC data for testing and development
- **lib/modbus-client.ts** - Core Modbus communication client with real-time monitoring
- **lib/enhanced-monitor.ts** - Advanced monitoring with dynamic register discovery

### Next.js Frontend
- **app/page.tsx** - Basic monitoring dashboard 
- **app/enhanced/page.tsx** - Advanced monitoring with AI-powered register discovery
- **components/register-monitor.tsx** - Basic real-time register monitoring component
- **components/enhanced-register-monitor.tsx** - Advanced tabbed interface with intelligent features
- **components/ui/** - Radix UI components with Tailwind CSS styling
- **types/modbus.ts** - TypeScript type definitions

### AI-Powered Scanning System
- **lib/enhanced-scanner.ts** - Parallel scanning with adaptive batch sizing and intelligent analysis
- **lib/scan-optimizer.ts** - Historical scan analysis and optimization recommendations  
- **examples/enhanced-scanning-example.ts** - Complete usage examples with progress tracking
- **scripts/smart-scan.ts** - CLI tool for performance comparison and optimization

### Legacy Components (src/)
- **modbus-scanner.js** - Original sequential scanner
- **data-analyzer.js** - Pattern recognition for register types
- **mqtt-bridge.js** - Home Assistant MQTT integration
- **packet-capture.js** - Network analysis tools

### Configuration System
- **config/modbus-config.json** - Base configuration with known register mappings
- **config/enhanced-scan-config.json** - Generated by AI analysis
- **.env** - Environment variables (copy from .env.example)

### Data Flow Architecture

**Real-time Monitoring Flow:**
1. **WebSocket Server** connects to Modbus device (or demo simulation)
2. **Continuous Polling** reads known registers every 2 seconds
3. **Change Detection** compares new values with cached previous values
4. **WebSocket Broadcast** sends changes to all connected web clients
5. **UI Updates** display register changes with timestamps in real-time

**Enhanced Discovery Flow:**
1. **Parallel Scanning** across multiple address ranges (1000-2200)
2. **Pattern Recognition** analyzes values to identify register types (temperature/switch/control)
3. **Confidence Scoring** rates reliability of discovered registers
4. **Dynamic Registration** adds discovered registers to monitoring pool
5. **Historical Learning** improves future scans based on success patterns

### Key Technical Features

**Real-time Change Tracking:**
- Monitor register changes while operating AC remotely 
- Identify unknown register functions through usage patterns
- 50-entry change history with timestamps
- Separate tracking for known vs dynamically discovered registers

**Multiple Server Modes:**
- **Demo Mode** (`npm run ws:demo`) - Simulated data with auto-changing temperature sensors
- **Enhanced Mode** (`npm run ws:enhanced`) - Real Modbus integration with discovery
- **Basic Mode** (`npm run ws`) - Simple monitoring of predefined registers

**Web Interface Options:**
- **Basic Monitor** (http://localhost:3002) - Simple register monitoring
- **Enhanced Monitor** (http://localhost:3002/enhanced) - Tabbed interface with discovery tools

### Key Dependencies
- **Next.js 14 + TypeScript** - Modern full-stack web framework
- **modbus-serial** - Modbus TCP/RTU communication
- **ws** - WebSocket server for real-time communication
- **Radix UI + Tailwind CSS** - Modern component library and styling
- **mqtt** - Home Assistant MQTT integration  
- **winston** - Structured logging

## Development Notes

### Configuration Workflow
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure MODBUS_HOST and MQTT settings
2. Run `npm run scan:smart` for optimized discovery of air conditioner registers
3. Check `config/enhanced-scan-config.json` for AI-identified parameters
4. Use `npm run scan:stats` to view scan history and optimization suggestions
5. Fine-tune register mappings if needed

### Scanning Strategy Selection
- **Basic scanning** (`npm run scan`) - Traditional sequential scanning
- **Enhanced scanning** (`npm run scan:enhanced`) - Parallel with intelligent analysis
- **Smart scanning** (`npm run scan:smart`) - Adaptive with history optimization
- **Performance comparison** (`npm run scan:compare`) - Benchmark different strategies

### Testing Modbus Connection
Use `npm run test` to verify connectivity before running other services. For performance analysis, use `npm run scan:stats` to view historical scan data.

### Optimization Tips
- First run typically takes longer for full discovery
- Subsequent runs use incremental scanning for faster results
- High-priority ranges (1030-1180) are scanned first
- Adaptive batch sizing optimizes for device response characteristics
